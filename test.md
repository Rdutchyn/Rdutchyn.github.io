# Projects & Engineering Groups

## Capstone - Xinc2 Based 3D Printer Controller
- Sept 2024 - April 2025
#### Commissioned by Eleven Engineering

Developed over September 2024 - April 2025,  This project was the culmination of 4 years of studying. Our group developed the controller around the XinC2 Micro controller from Eleven Engineering, with the ATLAS dev board as the basis of the design. My primary focus was on the hardware development of the controller. The hardware was developed from the ground up around 4 Primary constraints.

1. Detect and Read slicer files from an SD card
2. Maintain heaters at the desired temperature within ±1 °C
	1. Maximum of 220°C for printer head
	2. Maximum of 80 ° C for the hot bed
3. Capable of Serial Communication
4. Compatible with both a 24V and 12V Power supply

## University of Alberta Ecocar
The UAlberta Ecocar team is a hydrogen vehicle engineering club at the University of Alberta. I was a member of the club from Sept 2022 to July 2025, and was an Executive member from June 2023 - Jul 2025. The CLub participates annually in the Shell Eco marathon every April. During my time on the team we placed first in SEMA 2024 & 2025 in the prototype hydrogen category. 

As a member of Ecocar I was involved in the development of several PCB designs for key vehicle systems. The two primary developments I was involved in was the design of a **hydrogen sensor board** and a revised **fuel cell controller**. As an executive I secured a major sponsorship for the electrical from **Tektronix**. They provided our team with a MSO 2 Oscilliscope, with an estimated value of $10 000 CAD with all included accessories and modules.

## LED Strip Sunrise Alarm Clock

As a personal project, I am designing a sunrise alarm clock that uses an LED strip as the light source. Living in Northern Alberta, one of my biggest struggles in the winter is dealing with the darkness in the early mornings. In my experience with traditional sunrise alarm clocks, they do not offer enough light, and even enough lighting to properly wake me up in the morning. My hope is that with this project I will be able to endure the dark and cold mornings of Northern Alberta with a little more enjoyment.
